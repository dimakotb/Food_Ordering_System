This Java-based console application is a restaurant management system developed as an academic project to demonstrate object-oriented programming and clean software design using multiple design patterns. It supports user and order management, discount creation and notification, multiple payment methods, receipt generation, and database interaction via JDBC. The system applies the Singleton pattern for admin control, Observer pattern for notifying customers about discounts, Strategy pattern for flexible discount calculation, State pattern for managing order status, and Decorator pattern for customizable receipts, resulting in a modular, scalable, and maintainable application structure suitable for real-world scenarios.
